I just started building this website...

I am a third year graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Caltech, supervised by [Changhuei Yang](https://biophot.caltech.edu/). My current research involves two directions. (a) Computational microscopy with model-based and/or learning-based methods for biological and clinical applications, (b) Deep learning enabled methods for digital pathology. 

I am particularly interested in exploring how microscope systems, algorithms, and scientific applications interconnect.
