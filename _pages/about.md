I am a third year graduate student in Department of Electrical Engineering at Caltech, supervised by [Changhuei Yang](https://biophot.caltech.edu/). My current research involves two directions. (a) Compuatational microscopy using model-based and/or learning-based methods with applications in biological and clinical applications. (b) Deep learning enabled methods for digital pathology. 

I am interested in exploring the inter-connections among microscope systems, learning-based methods, and biological / clinical applications.
