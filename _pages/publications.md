[BibiTex](_publications/Sulfur dioxide gas-sensitive.txt)

<!-- We demonstrate the synthesis of gas-sensing materials for sulfur dioxide, namely, carbon nanotube networks based on zinc-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) (bimetallic MOFs). The particles synthesized via bimetal co-doping of cobalt and zinc and the pyrolysis process possess a porous polyhedral morphology with abundant interconnecting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the surface, which results in significant sensitivity, cross-selectivity and durability towards SO2 at room temperature. -->
